  <h1>Death by... </h1>
  
  <h3>Lawnmower</h3>
  
  <p>
 It is a nice day, and you are walking along with your trusty dog, Sam, when all of a sudden Sam begins to bark up at the sky. You see a small object far above in the sky and resume your walk as you conclude that the object must be a bird or a plane. 5 minutes pass but Sam has been acting strange, looking around and whining quietly. Then Sam once again begins to bark up at the sky; this time he has stopped walking and is staring straight up at the sky. Frustrated you try to pull Sam but he wonâ€™t budge. Now you are incredibly irritated and you turn around to tell Sam its only a bird but you see a lawnmower hurtling towards you as panic consumes your body. The lawnmower hits your body with crushing force. Sam is finally free from your reign of terror and lives a life of tranquility and happiness with a homeless man. A lawnmower has killed you. Not even like a good lawnmower like a John Deere or anything, like one of those really old rusty ones that half the time don't even work. C'mon man.
